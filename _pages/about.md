I am currently a Postdoc Researcher at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, IL. I obtained my Ph.D. in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering from Old Dominion University, Norfolk. Prior to this, I had some doctoral level courses from Computational Modeling and Simulation Engineering where I received my Master of Science degree. I also hold an MBA degree from Strayer University. Before obtaining my high level degrees, I graduated from International Black Sea University in Tbilisi, Georgia with a bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering.

Following topics are the areas that I am currently working on:

   * Freight Transportation and Modeling
   * Agent-Based Simulation
   * Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) Technologies
   * Intelligent Transportation Systems
   * Transportation Informatics/Data Analytics
   * Transportation Simulation and Modeling
   * Transportation Safety
