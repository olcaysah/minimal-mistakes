I am currently a PhD. candidate at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Prior to this, I had some doctoral level courses from Computational Modeling and Simulation Engineering where I received my Master of Science degree. I also hold an MBA degree from Strayer University. Before obtaining my high level degrees, I graduated from International Black Sea University in Tbilisi, Georgia with a bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering.

I am working with my doctoral advisor who is [Dr. Mecit Cetin](http://www.tri-odu.org/meet-the-director.html){:target="_blank"} in [Transportation Research Institute](http://www.tri-odu.org){:target="_blank"} at Old Dominion University.

Following topics are the interested areas that I am currently working on:

   * Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV)
   * Electric Vehicles (EV)
   * Smart Grid
   * Intelligent Transportation Systems
   * Transportation Informatics/Data Analytics
   * Transportation Simulation and Modeling
   * Transportation Safety
